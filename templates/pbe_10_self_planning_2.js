/**
1. Only essential steps are necessary for prompt. Detailed explanations in the prompt can obstruct
the modelâ€™s ability to decompose the task and should be avoided. The model can independently
perform the necessary details to fulfill the intent.
2. Clearly specify a set of rules. Ensure that all examples in the prompt exhibit a consistent pattern,
such as beginning with a verb or using consistent language constructs, such as "if," "check,"
"return," "create," etc.
3. Select examples that represent the majority of cases. It is important not to include examples that
are atypical or marginal as this may negatively impact the performance of the model. The selected
examples should be of average length and representative of typical tasks and solutions.
4. Incorporate code features. The desired functionality, such as the definition of helper functions
and the importation of libraries, can be introduced into the prompt through the use of directive
statements.
